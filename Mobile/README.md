## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (with version >= 9.0, for Swift 4.0) and the Simulator. You can download Xcode from the App Store on your Mac. It comes with the Simulator as well as all necessary SDKs.

### Apple Developer Account

You need to register for an Apple Developer Account [here](https://developer.apple.com/account/). It will give you access to latest updates as well as documentations. You can use your iCloud account, if you already have one.

### Version support

This project is using Swift 4.0 targeting iOS 11.0.

### Setup

If this is your first time running Xcode, you will need to log in to your Apple Developer Account (Xcode > Preferences > Account). Once logged in, click _Manage Certificates_ to make sure you have an iOS Development Certificate.
