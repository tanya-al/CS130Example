# CS130 - Simplicity

## Project Structure
Our project structure is as follows. The backend server code is under the Backend folder, which contains the server routes, endpoints functions, tesseract image processing API calls, and testing for all of the above. Our app is under the Mobile folder, under Simplicity. Setup instructions for running the app are below. The XCode project workspace includes all of the app code, unit tests, and request code for querying the backend. The docs folder contains our auto-generated documentation for both the front and back end APIs.

##Project Setup
To setup the project, simply clone the repo.
```git clone https://github.com/theAnthonyLai/CS130.git```
Then, navigate to Mobile/Simplicity/Simplicity.xcworkspace and open that file in XCode. **IMPORTANT** Opening Simplicity.xcodeproj will NOT load all the necessary features. 

Once XCode opens, connect your iPhone device to your laptop and in the top left corner of the window select "iPhone" instead of "Generic iOS device". Then hit Command+R to run the app.
